    <div class="container">
        <div id="c53"><h1 class="csc-firstHeader">Privacy Policy</h1><p>Welcome to Dimensiva - 3D Camera (&quot;Dimensiva - 3D Camera&quot;, &quot;Dimensiva&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). Dimensiva provides a fast, simple and beautiful way for you to create and share 3D media through our platform. Just take two slightly shifted photos, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Dimensiva services (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>
<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (&quot;User Content&quot;), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (&quot;Users&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information you provide us directly:</p>
<p>Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Dimensiva account.</p>
<p>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number, Facebook or Twitter account). This information allows us to help you or others be &quot;found&quot; on Dimensiva.</p>
<p>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
<p>Communications between you and Dimensiva. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finding your friends on Dimensiva:</p>
<p>If you choose, you can use our &quot;Find friends&quot; feature to locate other people with Dimensiva accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Dimensiva.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Dimensiva will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Dimensiva.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Dimensiva then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
<p>Note about &quot;Invite Friends&quot; feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our &quot;Invite friends&quot; feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Dimensiva does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analytics information:</p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies:</p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Dimensiva and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log file information:</p>
<p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device identifiers:</p>
<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more &quot;device identifiers.&quot; Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Dimensiva.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metadata:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in</p>
<p>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;</p>
<p>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</p>
<p>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</p>
<p>develop and test new products and features</p>
<p>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</p>
<p>diagnose or fix technology problems</p>
<p>automatically update the Dimensiva application on your device Dimensiva or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities (&quot;Events&quot;) on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Dimensiva (or the group of companies of which Dimensiva is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parties with whom we may share your information:</p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Dimensiva is part of, or that become part of that group (&quot;Affiliates&quot;). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.</p>
<p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (&quot;Service Providers&quot;). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
<p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</p>
<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</p>
<p>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under our Dimensiva API. The use of the Dimensiva API is subject to the API Terms of Use which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Dimensiva API have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your account information and profile/privacy settings:</p>
<p>Update your account at any time by logging in and changing your profile settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimensiva does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service.

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 14 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 14, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access your User Content you do so at your own risk.</p>
